# My-Times
# Procject from Freeland Website Development through Codecademy

My-Times was a project from Codecademy focusing on different aspects of positioning.

During this project, we dove deeper into background images, parent/child containers, and how different containers interact.

Difficulties: 
  1. I feel confident in the structure of HTML. This project was the first website built from scratch I worked on CSS layout with collums, background images with centered text, fixed objects and other CSS layout aspects. I'm happy with the end product, but getting everything to line up with parent/child containers was more diffcult than anticipated.
